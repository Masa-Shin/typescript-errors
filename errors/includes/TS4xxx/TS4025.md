## TS4025

> error TS4025: Exported variable '`App`' has or is using private name '`FC`'.

### Broken Code ❌

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const App: FC = (): JSX.Element => {
  return <></>;
};
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

When using an external type (like `FC`) you also have to make sure that it is imported:

```tsx
import React, {FC} from 'react';

const App: FC = (): JSX.Element => {
  return <></>;
};
```
