## TS7027

> error TS7027: Unreachable code detected.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
process.exit(0);
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Your code cannot print text to the **standard output** when your program is told to exit beforehand, so you have to remove the call to exit or place it at a later point in time:

```ts
console.log('Hello, World!');
process.exit(0);
```
