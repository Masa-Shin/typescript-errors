## TS7034

> error TS7034: Variable '`expectations`' implicitly has type '`any[]`' in some locations where its type cannot be determined.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const expectations = [];
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

An array can collect values of different types, so we have to tell TypeScript which types we want to collect:

```ts
const expectations: string[] = [];
```

If we want to specify multiple types, we have to define a [**union type**](/glossary/index.html#Union-Types):

```ts
const expectations: (string | number)[] = [];
expectations.push('1');
expectations.push(2);
```

Alternative:

```ts
type ArrayInput = string | number;
const expectations: ArrayInput[] = [];
expectations.push('1');
expectations.push(2);
```

Unrecommended solutions:

- Set "noImplicitAny" to `false` in your "tsconfig.json"
