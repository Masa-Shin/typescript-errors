## TS7008

> error TS7008: Member '`name`' implicitly has an 'any' type.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
abstract class Person {
  accessor name;
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

To fix the problem, you can initialize the class member so that TypeScript can infer the type:

```ts
abstract class Person {
  accessor name = 'unknown';
}
```

Alternatively, you can annotate the type:

```ts
abstract class Person {
  accessor name: string;
}
```
