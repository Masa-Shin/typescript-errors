## TS7031

> error TS7031: Binding element 'age' implicitly has an 'any' type.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
export function printAge({age}): void {
  console.log(age);
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

TypeScript complains because it doesn't know the type of the argument that we are destructuring. That's why it sets all its properties to the type of `any`. To prevent that we have to define a type for the parameter of the `printAge` function:

```ts
type Person = {
  age: number;
  name: string;
};

export function printAge({age}: Person): void {
  console.log(age);
}
```
