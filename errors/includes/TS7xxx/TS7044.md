## TS7044

> error TS7044: Parameter '`a`' implicitly has an '`any`' type, but a better type may be inferred from usage.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

From the body of the arrow function expression, TypeScript can see by the `*` that `a` and `b` may be of type `number`:

```ts
const multiply = (a: number, b: number) => a * b;
```
