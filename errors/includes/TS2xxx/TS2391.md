## TS2391

> error TS2391: Function implementation is missing or not immediately following the declaration.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract name: string;
  makeNoise(): string;
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

An abstract class is different from an interface. You have to use the `abstract` modifier if you want to define a contract in an abstract class. If there is no `abstract` modifier you will have to provide a implementation.

Solution 1:

To solve the problem, we can mark `makeNoise` with the `abstract` keyword. That will enforce derived classes to implement this method on their own:

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract name: string;
  abstract makeNoise(): string;
}
```

Solution 2:

Another solution is to provide a base implementation for `makeNoise`:

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract name: string;
  makeNoise(): string {
    return 'Woof';
  }
}
```
