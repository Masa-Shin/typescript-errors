> error TS2430: Interface '`StockExchange`' incorrectly extends interface '`Exchange`'.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
interface Exchange {
  address: string;
}

export interface StockExchange extends Exchange {
  address?: string;
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔

The `address` in `Exchange` is a mandatory property but in `StockExchange` it is declared as being optional which creates an incompatibility in the type. To fix the error, the property `address` has either to become optional or mandatory in both declarations:

```ts
interface Exchange {
  address: string;
}

export interface StockExchange extends Exchange {
  address?: string;
}
```
