## TS2794

> error TS2794: Expected 1 arguments, but got 0. Did you forget to include '`void`' in your type argument to '`Promise`'?

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve();
});
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

When a Promise resolves with nothing, you need to define that as a [**type argument**](/glossary/index.html#Type-Argument) to the generic `Promise`:

```ts
await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve();
});
```
