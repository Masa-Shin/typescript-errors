## TS2663

> error TS2663: Cannot find name '`firstName`'. Did you mean the instance member '`this.firstName`'?

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
class Person {
  get firstName(): string {
    return firstName;
  }
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

If you want to use a **getter**, you need to back it up with a private property:

```ts
class Person {
  private _firstName: string = '';

  get firstName(): string {
    return this._firstName;
  }
}
```

Starting from TypeScript 4.9, you can also use an [auto-accessor](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/49705) field:

```ts
class Person {
  accessor firstName: string = '';
}
```
