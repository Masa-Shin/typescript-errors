## TS2571

> error TS2571: Object is of type 'unknown'.

### Broken Code ❌

If you use third-party libraries then it can happen that TypeScript cannot infer all return types. In such a case a return type can be `unknown` which makes it impossible to access its properties from TypeScript. In the following example such case is constructed by assigning `unknown` to an exemplary constant:

```ts
const x: unknown = 1337;
console.log(x.toString());
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

To solve the problem of accessing properties from an unknown object, we have to define the type of the object which we want to access:

```ts
const x: number = 1337;
console.log(x.toString());
```

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
export const hasUsers = (payload: unknown): payload is {users: string[]} => {
  return 'users' in payload;
};
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

If your variable is of type `unknown`, then you can use a **type guard** to narrow the type of your variable. If you want to be sure that you have an object at hand, you can use the `typeof` type guard:

```ts
export const hasUsers = (payload: unknown): payload is {users: string[]} => {
  if (payload && typeof payload === 'object') {
    return 'users' in payload;
  }
  return false;
};
```

### Alternative

You may also get the error "Object is of type 'unknown'" when catching errors. In this case you have to [type the error in your catch clause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GLYiJUBz6k).
