## TS2720

> error TS2720: Class '`Dog`' incorrectly implements class '`Animal`'. Did you mean to extend '`Animal`' and inherit its members as a subclass? Property '`makeNoise`' is protected but type '`Dog`' is not a class derived from '`Animal`'.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  protected abstract makeNoise(): string;
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  protected makeNoise(): string {
    return 'Woof!';
  }
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

The `implements` keyword is reserved to implement interfaces. If you want to work with class inheritance, you have to use `extends`:

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  protected abstract makeNoise(): string;
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  protected makeNoise(): string {
    return 'Woof!';
  }
}
```
