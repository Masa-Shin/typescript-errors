## TS2814

> error TS2814: Function with bodies can only merge with classes that are ambient.

### Solution

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
class MyClass {}

function MyClass(): void {}
```

Your `function` cannot be named after your `class`, so you will have to rename your function:

### Fixed Code ✔️

```ts
class MyClass {}

function MyFunctionWithAnotherName(): void {}
```

Alternatively you can declare an ambient class which gets implemented by your function:

```ts
declare class MyClass {}

function MyClass(): void {}
```
