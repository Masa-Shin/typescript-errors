## TS2567

> error TS2567: Enum declarations can only merge with namespace or other enum declarations. `lib.dom.d.ts(18299, 6)`: 'ResponseType' was also declared here.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
enum ResponseType {
  ACTIVE,
  ERROR,
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

In the broken code shown above, a `type ResponseType` is already declared as part of the "dom" typings. Enums can be merged with other enums but since the other declaration of `ResponseType` is a `type`, we cannot merge the existing declaration with our custom one. That's why we have to remove "dom" from the "lib" entries in our "tsconfig.json" file or use a different name for our `enum`:

```ts
enum MyResponseType {
  ACTIVE,
  ERROR,
}
```
