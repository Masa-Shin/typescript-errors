## TS2582

> error TS2582: Cannot find name 'test'. Do you need to install type definitions for a test runner? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/jest` or `npm i --save-dev @types/mocha`.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
test('create sum', () => {
  expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
});
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

The error above is very specific to your testing framework and when using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) it can be easily solved by installing definition files for Jest (`npm i --save-dev @types/jest`).

When you are using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), then you would have to make sure that you properly import Playwright's definition for `test`:

```ts
import {test, expect} from '@playwright/test';

test('create sum', () => {
  expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
});
```
