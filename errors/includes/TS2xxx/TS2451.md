## TS2451

> error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable '`window`'.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const window = 'blue';
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Depending on the configuration of "lib" in your "tsconfig.json" file, there might be global variables that are present (like `window` when using the "dom" library provided by TypeScript). In this case you cannot redeclare the global variable and have to choose another name:

```ts
const myWindow = 'blue';
```
