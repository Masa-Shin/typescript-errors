### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const userName = {name: 'Benny'};
const userAge = {age: 35};
const user = userName & userAge;
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

When you want to merge two objects, you have a multitude of possibilities:

**Spread Syntax**

```ts
const userName = {name: 'Benny'};
const userAge = {age: 35};
const user = {
  ...userName,
  ...userAge,
};
```

**Object.assign**

```ts
const userName = {name: 'Benny'};
const userAge = {age: 35};
const user = Object.assign({}, userName, userAge);
```
