## TS2611

> error TS2611: '`name`' is defined as a property in class '`Person`', but is overridden here in '`MyPerson`' as an accessor.

### Broken Code ‚ùå

```ts
abstract class Person {
  name: string = 'unknown';
}

class MyPerson extends Person {
  get name(): string {
    return `${super.name.toUpperCase}`;
  }
}
```

Getters and setters are property accessors, so you have to make sure that you don't mix **property** definitions with **property accessor** definitions. Using the `accessor` keyword, you can turn a property into a property accessor:

```ts
abstract class Person {
  accessor name: string = 'unknown';
}

class MyPerson extends Person {
  get name(): string {
    return `${super.name.toUpperCase}`;
  }
}
```
