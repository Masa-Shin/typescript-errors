## TS2786

> error TS2786: '`Component`' cannot be used as a JSX component.

### Broken Code ❌

```tsx
import type {NextPage} from 'next';
import type {AppProps} from 'next/app';

type AppPropsWithLayout = AppProps & {
  Component: NextPage & {
    getLayout?: (page: React.ReactElement) => React.ReactNode;
  };
};

export default function AdvisoryApp({Component, pageProps}: AppPropsWithLayout): JSX.Element {
  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? (page => page);
  return <>{getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)}</>;
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Usually the problem derives from a mismatch in `@types/react`. When you have libraries that are dependent on a specific version of `@types/react` (i.e. v17.0.47) and you have other libraries working with another major version of `@types/react` (i.e. v18.0.14), then this can cause compatibility issues when using `React.ReactNode` or `JSX.Element`. You have to streamline your dependencies on `@types/react`, so that these follow the same major version.

You can find all libraries depending on `@types/react` in your project by executing `npm explain @types/react` (when a `package-lock.json` file is present) or `yarn why @types/react` (when a `yarn.lock` file is present).
