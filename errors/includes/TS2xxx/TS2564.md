## TS2564

> error TS2564: Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.

This error can occur with TypeScript 2.7 in "strict" mode. TypeScript 2.7 introduced a new flag called `--strictPropertyInitialization`, which tells the compiler to check that each instance property of a class gets initialized in the constructor body, or by a property initializer. See [Strict Class Initialization](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What's-new-in-TypeScript#strict-class-initialization).

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
class Dog {
  private name: string;
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

We have to initialize the `name` member either at its definition or within the `constructor`.

Solution 1:

```ts
class Dog {
  private name: string = 'Laika';
}
```

Solution 2:

```ts
class Dog {
  private name: string;

  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Laika';
  }
}
```

Solution 3:

```ts
class Dog {
  constructor(private name: string = 'Laika') {}
}
```
