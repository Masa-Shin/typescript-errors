## TS2677

> error TS2677: A type predicate's type must be assignable to its parameter's type. Type '`number`' is not assignable to type '`string`'.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const isInteger = (input: string): input is number => {
  return !!parseInt(input, 10);
};
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

The `input` is declared to be of type `string` which is why the **type predicate** cannot turn it into a `number` because these two declarations are mutually exclusive. That's why we have to declare an input type of `any`:

```ts
const isInteger = (input: any): input is number => {
  return !!parseInt(input, 10);
};
```
