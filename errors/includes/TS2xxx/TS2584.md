## TS2584

> error TS2584: Cannot find name 'console'. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to include 'dom'.

### Broken Code ❌

TypeScript code:

```ts
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

TypeScript compiler configuration (`tsconfig.json`):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2017"]
  }
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

You have to add the following to your "tsconfig.json" file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2017", "dom"]
  }
}
```

When you are working on an application which never runs in a browser but only in Node.js environments, then you could add `@types/node` to your `devDependencies` instead of adding `"dom"` to your `"lib"` section.
