## TS2352

> error TS2352: Conversion of type '`{ name: string; age: number; }`' to type '`Person`' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to '`unknown`' first.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
type Person = {
  firstName: string;
  age: number;
};

const myObject = {
  name: 'Benny',
  age: 34,
} as Person;
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Make sure all properties of your object match the properties of your declared type:

```ts
type Person = {
  firstName: string;
  age: number;
};

const myObject = {
  firstName: 'Benny',
  age: 34,
} as Person;
```

Alternative but not recommended: Convert your object to `unknown` first:

```ts
type Person = {
  firstName: string;
  age: number;
};

const myObject = {
  name: 'Benny',
  age: 34,
} as unknown as Person;
```
