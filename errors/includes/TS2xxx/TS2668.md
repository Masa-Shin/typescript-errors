## TS2668

> error TS2668: 'export' modifier cannot be applied to ambient modules and module augmentations since they are always visible.

### Info

**Ambient modules**

To describe the shape of libraries not written in TypeScript, we need to declare the API that the library exposes. We call declarations that don’t define an implementation “**ambient**”. Typically, these are defined in `.d.ts` files. If you’re familiar with C/C++, you can think of these as `.h` files.

**Module Augmentation**

With module augmentation, users have the ability to extend existing modules such that consumers can specify if they want to import the whole module or just a subset.
