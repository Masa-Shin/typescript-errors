## TS2715

> error TS2715: Abstract property 'name' in class 'Animal' cannot be accessed in the constructor.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract name: string;
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name: string) {
    super();
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

The `name` member of the abstract `Animal` class is `abstract`, so we have to define it ourselves in the derived class `Dog`. Because `name` has no access modifier, it is `public` by default which means that our `Dog` class has to implement it with a `public` visibility:

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract name: string;
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  public name;

  constructor(name: string) {
    super();
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```
