## TS1431

> error TS1431: 'for await' loops are only allowed at the top level of a file when that file is a module, but this file has no imports or exports. Consider adding an empty 'export {}' to make this file a module.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const inputStream = fs.createReadStream('file.csv');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: inputStream,
  crlfDelay: Infinity,
});

for await (const line of rl) {
  console.log(line);
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Just add the imports for the `fs` module and `readline` module in order to turn your code into a module itself:

```ts
import fs from 'node:fs';
import readline from 'node:readline';

const inputStream = fs.createReadStream('file.csv');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: inputStream,
  crlfDelay: Infinity,
});

for await (const line of rl) {
  console.log(line);
}
```
