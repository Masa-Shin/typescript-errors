## TS1219

> error TS1219: Experimental support for decorators is a feature that is subject to change in a future release. Set the 'experimentalDecorators' option in your 'tsconfig' or 'jsconfig' to remove this warning.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
import {Injectable} from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Simply set "experimentalDecorators" to `true` in your "tsconfig.json" file. As long as decorators are experimental you will also have to install the [reflect-metadata](https://github.com/rbuckton/reflect-metadata) package to shim the upcoming Metadata Reflection API for ECMAScript. For proper functionality the "emitDecoratorMetadata" option should also be set to `true`.
