## TS1068

> error TS1068: Unexpected token. A constructor, method, accessor, or property was expected.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
class User {
  constructor(private firstName: string, private lastName: string) {
  }

  function getName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Functions that are part of a class are being called "method". The method of a class is defined without the `function` keyword:

```ts
class User {
  constructor(private firstName: string, private lastName: string) {}

  getName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```
