## TS1389

> error TS1389: 'this' is not allowed as a variable declaration name.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const this = 'something';
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

The name `this` cannot be used to declare a variable because it is already a reserved keyword to refer to the current object in a method or constructor.

That's why you have to choose a different name:

```ts
const that = 'something';
```
